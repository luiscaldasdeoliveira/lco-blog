Minimalism is not just about removing elements; it's about focusing on what matters.

> "Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away." - Antoine de Saint-Exupéry

1.  **Whitespace**: Give your content room to breathe.
2.  **Typography**: Use high-quality fonts and ensure good readability.
3.  **Color**: Use color sparingly to guide attention.
