This is an example blog post showing off the integration of **Markdown** and *Astro*.

## Why Astro?

Astro is fantastic for content-focused websites. It ships zero JavaScript to the client by default.

### Code Example

Here is a snippet of code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
function helloWorld() {
  console.log("Hello, World!");
}
```

## Typography

This layout uses the Tailwind Typography plugin to automatically style Markdown content. It is clean, legible, and minimalist.
